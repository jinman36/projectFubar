# Final Project

## Seattlight
    - We built this website with the intent to help the user make a decision on what to choose to do for a night out. Utilizing Javascript, the user can choose between a series of picture choices that will help us create a custom recommendation, stored to local storage, that will be displayed by following the recommendations link to the following page, where our Chef Qadree will hand them their custom recommendation himself.
