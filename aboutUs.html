        Hello my name is Qadree Trimble. I've had a interesting life journey so far. I died twice in my early years as a child. I joined the Navy at 18 where I learned about computers and software and how to operate and fix them for 8 years.  I worked as a Sys Admin/Lan Administrator for 10 years on the east coast after I discharged from service. 
        Then I moved to Seattle in 2014. I graduated culinary school at Le Cordon Bleu in 2016 and even spent a few years in homelessness as I worked at my last job as a Chef Instructor who taught adult apprentices and students coming out of incarceration and homelessness. My reason for stepping into software development is mainly because I want to acquire the skills necessary for building websites and apps for my own business ventures and because I've always fantasized about being a coder and trying it out in life. 
        Lastly one of my goals is to be able to give back or pay it forward by teaching teens of color coding as a CTE instructor in high school. </p>

        After mastering new recipes and taking many a long walk I realized that I was becoming stagnant and needed to find an outlet where I could continue to learn and grow. I needed something that would challenge me and something that I would enjoy. After looking at my options I couldn’t help but embrace the technology that is propelling us forward, utilizing both math and logic – things I’ve always enjoyed.
        In a field that, for all intents and purposes, has nearly infinite possibilities, I look forward to finding my niche in this ever growing and evolving field. I can't wait to couple my knowledge with the teamwork and independence I've learned while flying. Previously, I've learned how to </p>
