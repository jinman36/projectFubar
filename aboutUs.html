        Hello my name is Qadree Trimble. I've had a interesting life journey so far. I died twice in my early years as a child. I joined the Navy at 18 where I learned about computers and software and how to operate and fix them for 8 years.  I worked as a Sys Admin/Lan Administrator for 10 years on the east coast after I discharged from service. 
        Then I moved to Seattle in 2014. I graduated culinary school at Le Cordon Bleu in 2016 and even spent a few years in homelessness as I worked at my last job as a Chef Instructor who taught adult apprentices and students coming out of incarceration and homelessness. My reason for stepping into software development is mainly because I want to acquire the skills necessary for building websites and apps for my own business ventures and because I've always fantasized about being a coder and trying it out in life. 
        Lastly one of my goals is to be able to give back or pay it forward by teaching teens of color coding as a CTE instructor in high school. </p>

        Hi! I’m Morgan and I’ve spent the past 8 years serving sodas and saving lives, otherwise known as being a flight attendant. Up until March of last year I was perfectly content with my career path, but then I, along with everyone else, was forced to re-evaluate things on a personal and professional level. After mastering new recipes and taking many a long walks I realized that I was becoming stagnant and needed to find an outlet where I could continue to learn and grow. I needed something that would challenge me and something that I would enjoy. After looking at my options I couldn’t help but embrace the technology that is propelling us forward, utilizing both math and logic – things I’ve always enjoyed. I can't wait to couple my knowledge with the teamwork and independence I've learned while flying. Previously, I've learned how to meet people where they are, find a common ground and interact with them in a meaningful way. I can’t wait to put these skills to use when I collaborate with others in this field.</p>

      <p id="jeff"> Hello, my name is Jeff Inman. I am really enjoying the process of learning to code and am looking forward to continuing this journey into the future. Originally from Eastern Washington but have found my way to the West side of the state after a hiatus in Tennessee and North Carolina. I am currently working as a Project Manager at a commercial Construction Company in the Seattle Area but would love to be able to get back to the Eastern Side of Washington and am hoping that learning this additonal skill will help me get there. </p>
